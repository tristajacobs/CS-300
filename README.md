# CS 300 Portfolio Submission

## Reflection

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**  
In Project One, I analyzed the runtime and memory use for different data structures (vector, hash table, and binary search tree) to design an efficient advising program. In Project Two, I developed a C++ program that reads a course list from a file, sorts it alphanumerically, and prints course details.

**How did you approach the problem?**  
I compared multiple data structures and evaluated their runtime performance. I focused on selecting the most efficient yet simple solution, which led me to recommend using a vector for its predictable runtime and low overhead.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**  
When I encountered challenges understanding runtime costs and sorting in C++, I reviewed class materials, used outside resources, and tested small prototypes to validate my understanding before finalizing my approach.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**  
These projects taught me to think carefully about data structure choices early in the design process. I now better appreciate how much performance and future flexibility depend on foundational design decisions.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
I improved in writing modular, organized code that is easier to extend and debug. I’ve also developed better commenting habits to make the code understandable for future readers, including myself.
